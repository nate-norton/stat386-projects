# About Me
Hello! I am Nate Norton and welcome to my blog! I am a Statstics: Data Science student at Brigham Young University. I love learning and growing, a blog is the perfect place to practice and share that information. I look forward to graduating and getting into the workplace! Here are a couple of interesting facts about me: I got married this last summer (June 2022). I am on the BYU lacrosse team. And, I love greek food.
