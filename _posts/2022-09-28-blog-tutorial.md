# The Blind Men and an Elephant
A group of blind men wandered through the jungle when they came upon an elephant. Because they had never seen an elephant they did not know what it looked like, so they relied on their touch to find out. Each man started to feel a different part of the animal, one described the tusks as being smooth yet sharp so he determined this animal must be holding a spear. Another felt its trunk and was scared he had just stumbled upon a snake. Each man described the animal in completely different ways. While they were all correct in what they saw and felt, they all had a completely different image of what this animal looked like. They needed a guide, someone who could see the whole picture to guide them around. That is where **YOU** come in.

Big data is like the elephant, and it is your job to help the blind see the full picture. A data scientist's job is to break down huge amounts of data, analyze it, and present it in a way that could be understood by everyone. However, if your work is presented poorly, the blind will be even more confused. Clear, concise, and direct data visualization is vital in a world that loves data. 

There are three big ways you can properly visualize your data to **UNDERSTAND** the elephant: *what's your story, keep it stupid simple, and format like a book.*

## 1. What's Your Story?
Before creating any visuals or adding any charts, ask yourself: what’s the story? What story are you trying to convey? What do you want your consumers to learn from this report? WHY are you making this? Take your time during this step, it is arguably the most important. Remember what the Cheshire cat said, "If you don’t know where you are going any road can take you there."

## 2. Keep it Stupid Simple
Once you have identified your story, start adding visuals to your report. Add visuals, cards, and statistics that will help you tell your story. Bar charts, tables, and pie charts are a great place to start. However, only add data that helps you tell your story. It can be easy to get excited in programs such as Tableau or Power B, but don’t get carried away be very intentional on what you are adding and why. Your goal is to take a complex data set and make it digestible for the consumer of your report. It’s like you a writing a research paper, but you are writing with graphs, charts, and key points of interest. Write as though you are presenting a simple one page summary and not a scholarly peer-reviewed essay.

## 3. Pattern Your Report Like a Book
Once you have identified your story and added key visuals. Present your visuals like a book. Do what is most natural to the human eye and place your visuals in a Z-pattern. The most important real estate on your report is in the top left corner, most reader’s eyes will land here first. Then in order of importance, continue placing your visuals in a zig-zag pattern until finished. This will create a visual hierarchy and a well-designed report.
